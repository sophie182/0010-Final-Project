    "The dataset I worked with measured three important things: meter rates, meter locations, and amount of meters. I sorted the zones into neighborhoods by hand, then found all zones in a neighborhood using pandas, and finally operated on the data of the neighborhood. I mainly was looking for the amount of meters, which will be useful for measuring our combined metric, and the rates, as that is my individual metric. To do this, I took the average of the rates in the neighborhoods, and the sum of all of the meters in the neighborhood. I am personally measuring is which neighborhood has the lowest meter costs. This location would be Carrick at 75 cents per hour. However, this is only my individual metric. There are shortcomings, such as the low total meter count, which is why it will be used as part of a combined metric, rather than the sole metric."
